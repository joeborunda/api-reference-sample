The site includes:\n\n- Clear endpoint summaries with parameter descriptions\n- Example requests and responses (JSON)\n- Authentication and error-handling guidance\n- Practical integration notes and usage tips\n\n\nWhat to expect next\n\nOver the next pages you'll see a few example endpoints, sample requests/responses, and an example SDK snippet to demonstrate the developer experience. If you'd like a custom example (e.g., GraphQL schema, webhook docs, or SDK samples), open an issue or message me and I will add it.\n\n— José"}]}}
