## General Overview

### Tone and content
----------------

*   [Be conversational and friendly](https://developers.google.com/style/tone) without being frivolous.
    
*   [Don't pre-announce anything](https://developers.google.com/style/future) in documentation.
    
*   [Use descriptive link text](https://developers.google.com/style/link-text).
    
*   [Write accessibly](https://developers.google.com/style/accessibility).
    
*   [Write for a global audience](https://developers.google.com/style/translation).
    

### Language and grammar

*   [Use second person](https://developers.google.com/style/person): "you" rather than "we."
    
*   [Use active voice](https://developers.google.com/style/voice): make clear who's performing the action.
    
*   [Use standard American spelling](https://developers.google.com/style/spelling) and punctuation.
    
*   [Put conditions before instructions](https://developers.google.com/style/sentence-structure), not after.
    
*   [For usage and spelling of specific words, see the word list](https://developers.google.com/style/wordlist).
    

### Formatting, punctuation, and organization


*   [Use sentence case](https://developers.google.com/style/capitalization) for document titles and section headings.
    
*   [Use numbered lists](https://developers.google.com/style/lists#types-of-lists) for sequences.
    
*   [Use bulleted lists](https://developers.google.com/style/lists#types-of-lists) for most other lists.
    
*   [Use description lists](https://developers.google.com/style/lists#types-of-lists) for pairs of related pieces of data.
    
*   [Use serial commas](https://developers.google.com/style/commas-serial).
    
*   [Put code-related text in code font](https://developers.google.com/style/code-in-text).
    
*   [Put UI elements in bold](https://developers.google.com/style/ui-elements).
    
*   [Use unambiguous date formatting](https://developers.google.com/style/dates-times).
    

### Images


*   [Provide alt text](https://developers.google.com/style/images#text-associated-with-images).
    
*   [Provide high-resolution or vector images](https://developers.google.com/style/images#high-resolution-images) when practical.
    

### Voice and Tone

When writing technical documentation, aim for a voice and tone that's conversational, friendly, and respectful without being overly colloquial or frivolous; a voice that's casual natural, and approachable, not pedantic or pushy. Try to sound like a knowledgeable friend who understands what the developer wants to do.

Use active voice whenever possible. Be careful not to change the meaning of a sentence when rewording from passive to active voice.

Don't pre-announce anything in documentation unless it has been approved by your legal counsel.
