Welcome — and thanks for visiting this API Reference sample site.

This repository demonstrates a concise, developer-focused documentation style I use when creating API references for clients. The site includes:

- Clear endpoint summaries with parameter descriptions
- Example requests and responses (JSON)
- Authentication and error-handling guidance
- Practical integration notes and usage tips


What to expect next

Over the next pages you'll see a few example endpoints, sample requests/responses, and an example SDK snippet to demonstrate the developer experience. If you'd like a custom example (e.g., GraphQL schema, webhook docs, or SDK samples), open an issue or message me and I will add it.
